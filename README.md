# dev.mentor React workshop

In this project you will build a searchable list of country cards with Covid-19 statistics and on the way you will learn how to apply Material-UI components, how to make requests with a help of React-Query library, using React-Router to navigate between the screens, and all this using the most popular library for building interactive user interfaces - React.
